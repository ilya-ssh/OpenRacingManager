# OpenRacingManager üèéÔ∏è

Open Racing Manager is a classic, F1-inspired racing management game built with [Pyxel](https://github.com/kitao/pyxel), a retro game engine for Python. 
Designed to capture the challenging simulation and strategy of motorsport management, the game focuses on deep gameplay mechanics and difficulty over graphical detail.
## About
This is an open-source passion project with plans to make something similar to Motorsport Manager/F1 Manager but with deeper progression and strategies.  

Mostly the project is influenced by aformentioned games but also by Dwarf Fortress because of its visual simplicity but overall depth.
For now the main "engine" is python and pyxel, though some other libraries used (see requirements.txt), however we may switch to Lua or Godot if such need arises.   
Currently, we want to stick with very simplistic visual style, almost reminiscent to Atari or NES, maximizing the gameplay elements and depth.
Feel free to contribute to the project, but first contact main developer.
